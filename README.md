## INTRODUCTION
This is a simple dailiy planner that allows the user to add important events to a daily planner to more effectively manage time. 

When the daily planner is opened, the current date and time are displayed at the top of the calendar in the Jumbotron section. When the user scrolls down, they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours. Each is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future using JavaScript to assign CSS classes.

When the user clicks into a time block, they can enter an event and click the save button, which stores the event text in local storage. When the page is refreshed, the saved data persist.

## TECHNOLOGIES
This project features HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JQuery, FontAwesome, Google Fonts, and Moment.js.

## SOURCES
Original challenge, CSS and HTML source code presented by Trilogy Education Services.
